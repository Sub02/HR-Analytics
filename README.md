📊 HR Performance Intelligence Dashboard

Department Benchmarking, Ranking & Tenure Analytics using Power BI

🔎 Project Objective
1.Analyze department-wise employee performance
2.Benchmark department ratings against overall company performance
3.Rank departments using DAX-based ranking logic
4.Evaluate employee tenure across departments
5.Design an executive-ready interactive HR dashboard

📌 Purpose of HR Analytics
To enable leadership teams to track, compare, and improve departmental performance using structured data modeling and benchmark-driven analysis.

📈 Significance of Examining HR Reports
1.Identify high-performing and underperforming departments
2.Compare department performance against company benchmark
3.Understand ranking hierarchy
4.Analyze employee service span distribution
5.Support data-driven HR strategy decisions

🧠 What the Dashboard Does
1.Compares Department Average Rating vs Company Average Rating
2.Ranks departments dynamically using RANKX
3.Calculates employee service span using DATEDIFF
4.Uses CALCULATE + ALL to remove filter context for benchmarking
5.Provides interactive slicer-based department analysis
6.Displays KPI cards for quick executive interpretation

🏗 Data Model Architecture

The project follows a Star Schema Design.

🔹 Dimension Table

Department Desc

Department ID

Department Name

🔹 Fact Table

EmployeeData

Employee ID

Department ID

Performance Rating

Start Date

End Date

Service Span

🔹 Relationship

Department Desc (1) → EmployeeData (*)

One-to-Many Cardinality

Single Direction Filtering

Corrected auto-detected relationship configuration


🔬 Key DAX Measures

Company Average Rating:
*Company Average Rating =
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(EmployeeData[PerformanceRating]),
    ALL(EmployeeData)
)*

Department Wise Rating:
*Department Wise Rating =
AVERAGE(EmployeeData[PerformanceRating])*

Department Rank:
*Department Rank =
RANKX(
    ALL('Department Desc'[Department]),
    [Department Wise Rating],
    ,
    DESC,
    DENSE
)*

Service Span (Calculated Column):
*Service Span(Emp) =
DATEDIFF(
    EmployeeData[StartDate],
    EmployeeData[Updated End Date],
    YEAR
)*

📈 Key Insights

1.Sales and IT departments perform above company benchmark.
2.Finance department shows below-average performance, indicating improvement scope.
3.Higher tenure departments demonstrate more stable rating patterns.
4.Ranking logic highlights competitive hierarchy across business units.

🚧 Challenges Faced

1.Auto-detected relationship initially created incorrect filter behavior.
2.Needed to correct cardinality to enforce proper star schema structure.
3.Managed filter context using CALCULATE and ALL.
4.Resolved slicer filtering issue by standardizing dimension usage.
5.Avoided many-to-many modeling complications.
